IPA:

- consonants
- vowels
- diacritics (modifiers)
  probably less is more
  sounds people know probably better
  biology impacts set of sounds people can make

Pick rules e.g. english based, less is more

pick n vowels e/g a, i, o
typically languages have min 1 back, 1 front and 1 unrounded
throw in some dipthongs

pick some consonants
try to remove entire features (voiced/unvoiced, places of articulation, manners of articulation)
symmetry between place + manner of articulation
1 or 2 uncommon sounds can make lang distinctive

phonotactics
pick more rules
syllables composed of:
onset: 0 - n costonants
nucleus: 1 - n vowels
coda: 0 - n costonants
pick some consonants/vowels that can only appear at specific places
some consonants never appear near each other
some consonant types never appear together in clusters (onset/coda)
Can make rules to make things easier to pronounce

root words
Start with phonotactics
link sounds to themes?
some sounds will be more common than others - distribution
