# Gameplay Ideas

## King/Ruler

### Map reveal

Player's view of the world is not real-time, it is a reflection of the information returned by their pawns

### Pawns

Each player is given a number of pawns they can control.

- Perhaps enough to begin developing your local region + do some small expansion

Pawns can be dispatched to:

- Explore/claim? territory
  - Roam until they find an unexplored tile
  - Claim the cell
  - Return to you and report back on their progress
- Dispatch orders/decrees
  - Navigate to owned territory
  - Change work allocations
- Raise an army
- Scout for enemies?
- Administrative jobs?
  - Collection of taxes
  - Update reports from the territory
  - Better collation of information and record keeping

As pawns transit through cells, they will note the most recent state of cell
This state will be updated on your world map when the pawn returns

travel between each cell takes time
pawns will leave a cell in the morning and arrive at the next in the evening

### Territory

Your base counts as territory
Territory can have allocated pawns do different work:

- Generate resources
- Trade with other cells
- Train military
  Allocations will be made as percentages rather than for individual pawns
- This means pawns will split their work
- This means reallocation of individual pawns is not required as population changes
  When territory is occupied by pawns, it will generate new pawns over time
  Resources can be sent back to the base
- Perhaps this requires a pawn to be sent to collect taxes/tribute

### Resources

It would be interesting for different tiles to produce different amounts of different resources
This would give cells an incentive to trade
resources can be spent on

- new pawns
- pawn improvements
  - military equipment
  - resource gathering equipment
  - Navigation equipment

### Military

Pawns have individual military effectiveness, which is increase by training
At some time you can instruct pawns to raise an army
This pawn will travel around to territory and send some percentage of pawns to your base
This means that other territories will take a hit to production - war is costly
Once your army has gathered, you can leave with it on conquest
As you travel through territory, you will consume some of that territory's resources (e.g. food)
If you encounter an enemy army, you enter combat???
combat on a cell reduces its output, so you may win but the prize is a bit diminished

### Interaction

Perhaps no direct trade with enemies
Perhaps occasionally you get information about enemies (from travellers/traders/spies) or questionable accuracy

### World Events

% chance of danger when traversing world - chance to lose pawns
% chance for cells to face hardship

- fires, famine, drought, disease
- could allocate resources from neighbouring settlements

### Where is the fun

- Trying to make good decisions based on fallible information
- Balancing resource generation with military
- Expanding your civilisations influence
- Combat has risk/reward. You might send out raiders and never hear from them again.

### Future ideas

Maybe you can allocate cells as "hubs" to make administration of nearby cells better
Perhaps hubs can switch allegiance or rebel
Perhaps there are neutral third party players
Maybe trade with enemies will happen, but through third parties
Maybe favour can be won/lost (through trade, marriages, military agreements like combat together or defense pacts)
